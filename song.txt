Can you walk on the water if I, you and I?
Because your blood's running cold outside the familiar true to life

Can you walk on the water with I, you and I?
Or keep your eyes on the road and live there familiar,
Without you and I
It glows with gates of gold, true to life

For our love is a ghost that the others can't see
It's a danger

Every shade of us you fade down to keep
Them in the dark on who we are
(Oh what you do to me)

Every shade of us you fade down to keep
Them in the dark on who we are
(Oh what you do to me)
